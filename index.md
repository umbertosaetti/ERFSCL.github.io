## Research Vision

Modeling, simulation, order reduction, and control of high-order models of the coupled flight dynamics, interactional aerodynamics, and aeroacoustics of rotary- and flapping-wing vehicles. These models are used for studies involving immersive simulations that make use of Extended Reality (XR), human-machine interaction, synthesis of advanced flight control laws, and development of innovative pilot cueing methods.
